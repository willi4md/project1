        <li>The client I chose for this project was my parents.</li>
        <li>My content was original and the third party images used from 'undraw.co' were used fairly.</li>
        <li>four pages- Sign In (Index.html), Dashboard, Timeclock, Schedule</li>
        <li>NavLink header for the main pages.</li>
        <li>Site uses navLinks in the header.</li>
        <li>Because of mostly using unique content instead of shared it was difficult to provide mobile
            versatility to each page. For this I focused on the dashboard. The dashboard page is compatible with mobile and dekstop.</li>
        <li>Shared style- header/sidebar</li>
        <li>The sites pages have several images and each has a relevant alt attribute.</li>
        <li>The favicon is a rocket.</li>
        <li>images -> in the images directory. css files -> in the css directory. js files -> not used.</li>
        <li>Didn't use the listed libraries or frameworks.</li>
        <li>Nu Validated- kind of</li>
        <li>I'd like to work on my alignment more with the navlinks but ran out of time. The alignment feels good but could be better.</li>
        <li>Used plenty of different and suitable fonts.</li>
        <li>the sign in page is a form</li>
        <li>Links to external sites through the social media footer</li>
        <li>transitions over the navlinks</li>
        <li>shared git with user twodee.</li>
        <li>lowercase files names, check!</li>
        <li>Obtained domain name for free!</li>
        <li>Followed the project 1 specs and served over https.</li>
        <li>Check!</li>
        <li>I didn't read the project specifications entirely through to the end, sorry about that.
            While I currently make this write-up for the itemized breakdown I am just realizing this was a part of the specs. :(</li>
