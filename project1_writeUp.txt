An itemized breakdown of how you believe you have met the expectations listed above:

1. The client I chose for this project was my parents.
2. My content was original and the third party images used from 'undraw.co' were used fairly.
3. Five pages- Sign In (Index.html), Sign Up, Dashboard, Timeclock, Schedule
4. NavLink header for the main pages.
5. Site uses navLinks in the header.
6. Because of mostly using unique content instead of shared it was difficult to provide mobile
versatility to each page. For this I focused on the dashboard. The dashboard page is compatible with mobile and dekstop.
7. Shared style- header/sidebar
8. The sites pages have several images and each has a relevant alt attribute.
9. The favicon is a rocket.
10. images -> in the images directory. css files -> in the css directory. js files -> not used.
11. Didn't use the listed libraries or frameworks.
12. 
13.
14. I used several different fonts for this project: Playfair display, Lato, etc.
15. Forms were used for the sign in/sign up pages.
16. Included links to my parents social media through the footer.
17. Formatted using vsCode and documented meaningful html/css.
18. 
19. On gitHub
20. My files are lowercase.
21.
22.
23.
24. I didn't read the project specifications entirely through to the end, sorry about that.
While I currently make this write-up for the itemized breakdown I am just realizing this was a part of the specs.
